# Project chatbot spell finder

The aim of the project was to build a chatbot using javascript. We made a chatbot that helps the user to find their spell inspired by the Harry Potter books. In our project we learned how make use of functions, eventlistners, variables and a conditonal. This project was made by a pair programming.
