# Project chatbot spell finder

The aim of the project was to build a chatbot using javascript. We made a chatbot that helps the user to find their spell inspired by the Harry Potter books. In our project we learned how make use of functions, eventlistners, variables and a conditonal. This project was made by a pair programming.

## The problem

It is the very first javascript project and the focus has been to understand the basics. We did initally have problems to identify all the different concepts in javascript and how they are supposed to be implemented. If we had more time we would make create questions and perhaps a dropdown.
